                From collecting the waste of flex banners, multiple steps are involved in converting them into carry bags.  
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Step 1:</strong> We carefully separate dust particles from the banners and clean them thoroughly.  
            </p>

                <strong>Step 2:</strong> After cleaning, we ensure the banners are strong enough to hold weight and are durable.  
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Step 3:</strong> Banners are cut into various sizes based on market demand and stitched into carry bags using strong, durable threads.  
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Step 4:</strong> Bags are customized to fit customer requirements, and they come in multiple sizes.
